# Cyber Heritage Posters

Created by Rachel L. Reynolds (2018)

## Background
As the Director of Operations for the US Air Force's enlisted cyber support training squadron, I undertook a pet project to exhibit role models airmen typically don't encounter in their classrooms.  Months of research, graphic design, budgeting, and advocacy ultimately triumphed.  In the schoolhouse where 5,200 troops a year from all walks of life come to study, the hallways have been transformed.  Today, there are over 30 inspirational displays dedicated to 9 unsung enlisted trailblazers; gay, transgender, and disabled technology leaders; 15 women pioneers; and cyber exemplars of 12 ethnicities (Armenian, Barbadian, Filipino, Jordanian, Mexican, and Nigerian Americans to name a few).  

## What's Here and How to Use It
In this repo, there are print-ready and editable verisons of the actual posters I created in the late 2010s; the editable files also serve as templates for creating new posters.
